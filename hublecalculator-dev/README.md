## 🚀 Project Update Details

### in this update i've added: 
- An input field that takes calculates the current input number
- functional buttons to add, subtract, multiply and divide
- An output field that displays the calculation history log
- An output field that displays the current answer and current number next to be added to the calculation before the operation and last calculated number
- Functionality that uses the current output number(answer) that will be used next before the next operation "+; -; x; /" pressed and the last number to be calculated is selected and inputed 

# Einstein's calculator Example: 

if 1 + 3 = 4 then the next number to be inputed before the operation "+; -; x; /" will be the answer that was outputed "4" meaning "4" is already in the calculation that awaits the users next selected operation "+; -; x; /" to be inputed/clicked, so when a user selects the next number before selecting an operator "+; -; x; /" that number for example "10" will be inputed after the user selects an operator "+; -; x; /" so if the "x" multiply operation is selected it will add it to the calculation before the current number selected in the input field like "4 x 10" which means the next number to be added last to the equation is the number currently in the input field "10" that will give us "4"(the last answer) "x" multiplied by "10"(currentInputNumber) "4 x 10 = 40" which will display "40" as the next result, and "40"  will be the first number in the equation followed by the current number in the input field before the next operation "+; -; x; /" is selected
